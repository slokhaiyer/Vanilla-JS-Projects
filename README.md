# Vanilla-JS-Projects
A collection of all the Vanilla JS projects. (Other than the individual ones)

Why did I create a separate repository for vanillaJS Projects ?
I am to improve these projects by recreating the apps using WebAR frameworks (Focusing on doing so in my hobby learning repo - private)
